# Chapt 1. Insights from Bitcoin

So far, very few people have truly understood the concept of Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work (PoW)! Let’s trace back to the source and revisit the Bitcoin White Paper published by Satoshi Nakamoto sixteen years ago:\
[English version](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Interestingly, a legendary figure in China, Li Xiaolai, produced a translation of the Bitcoin White Paper ten years after its release. His version reads smoothly (no wonder he was a senior English teacher at New Oriental), but it falls short in terms of technical accuracy! If you find the above version difficult to read, you might want to check out Li's version.

Let’s get straight to the point, starting with the abstract of the Bitcoin White Paper.

Abstract.&#x20;

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

The abstract describes the most crucial aspect of Bitcoin: Proof-of-Work (PoW). PoW is so important that it runs throughout the entire White Paper. In the very last sentence of the paper, Satoshi Nakamoto refers to PoW as a consensus mechanism:

“Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.”

This statement clearly tells us that PoW is a governance consensus, essentially a governance protocol. In Satoshi's design, PoW is composed of two main components: necessary rules and incentives. The enforcement aspect implies that PoW is indeed a governance protocol.\
(If you check the English dictionary, you'll find that the original meaning of “consensus” is “a generally accepted opinion or decision or agreement among a group of people.”)

As you can see, the Bitcoin White Paper primarily introduces PoW, but unfortunately, it does not provide a clear definition or complete description of PoW itself.

Let’s see how Wikipedia describes it:\
Proof-of-Work (PoW) is an economic measure designed to deter service and resource abuse, or denial-of-service attacks. It generally requires users to perform time-consuming and computationally complex calculations, whose answers can be quickly verified by the service provider. The time, equipment, and energy spent serve as collateral costs, ensuring that services and resources are being used by genuine demand.

So, even more regrettably, Wikipedia and other easily accessible online sources have intentionally or unintentionally seized on this omission by Satoshi and ignored the last sentence of the White Paper! Additionally, they overlook the special mention of the reward mechanism for PoW in the sixth section of the White Paper. These sources tend to emphasize how the work is done but not the necessity and significance of rewards—during a highly capitalistic era, PoW is presented as a way of saying, “you must work hard to earn money.” It fits neatly within a capitalist narrative. It's a pity that if Satoshi had named this consensus mechanism “Proof-of-Reward,” highlighting the importance of rewards in the system, the trajectory of blockchain development might have been vastly different!

In my textbook, I describe it this way:\
Proof-of-Work is a governance consensus driven by rewards and centered on the core task of bookkeeping.

To reiterate, the key to the success of Bitcoin's PoW is its reward system. From the content of the sixth section, we know that Bitcoin provides miners with a dual reward mechanism: first, all transaction fees from transfers are rewarded to miners. These fees are not claimed by Satoshi, which surpasses all centralized exchanges. However, this reward fundamentally comes from user contributions. The second reward is that Bitcoin gradually issues BTC to miners as a reward. The total issuance of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, and each one is slowly issued as a reward to miners by the system—this is the shocking “secret” of Bitcoin's PoW that capitalists have obscured for over a decade!

Indeed, all 21 million BTC were issued as rewards to miners through the system. This design is the crowning touch of PoW! I believe Satoshi’s primary intention was to remove the capitalist stench from BTC's issuance by adopting a perfectly rational approach. This design, viewed from a slightly different perspective, would astound many: the 21 million BTC designed by Satoshi are essentially a public reward fund of Bitcoin's PoW!

Now, here's the key point: In the design of PoW, Satoshi rejected the typical capitalist approach of promising big rewards with one hand (Bitcoin, often nicknamed the "big cake") while capitalizing on technology with the other. Technological capitalization refers to the practice of pre-selling “electronic cash” BTC as capital, allowing more capitalists to gain future anticipated value. By rejecting technological capitalization, Satoshi fundamentally rejected the traditional capitalist mode of production.

Therefore, Satoshi’s design of Bitcoin’s public reward fund carries profound implications! It ultimately inspires us that, guided by the governance consensus of Bitcoin’s PoW, what is being built is not a capitalist structure, but a new civilization for humanity!
